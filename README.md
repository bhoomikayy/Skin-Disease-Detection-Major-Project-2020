# Skin-Disease-Detection-Major-Project-2020
•	Title: Skin Disease Detection Using Machine Learning and Image Processing

•	Main goal of the project
Design and implement a model to efficiently classify and predict a skin abnormality/ disease a person might be suffering from by taking the image of the infected area and feeding it to the model.

•	Technologies used
	Backend: Google Colab, Netlify, Anaconda- Jupyter Notebook
	Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
	Project is tested on: Python 3.x
	OS: Ubuntu 18 LTS, Windows 7 or above

•	Steps to run the project

1.	Make sure you have right dependencies and python libraries.
2.	Open Skin Disease.ipynb on Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook. In case of Google Colab:
•	Upload your dataset files on Google Drive.
•	Mount your Drive on the required code file i.e. Skin Disease.ipynb by selecting Mount Drive option from the side bar.
•	A script apprears. Run the script. 
•	Select the account corresponding to the Google Drive containing your dataset. 
•	Copy the code in order to authorize the account.
3.	Run Skin Disease.ipynb.
4.	After the file completes its execution your model is saved as unet_model.json. Rename the model as model.json.
5.	Load the model in frontend JavaScript files.
6.	Load the JavaScript files in the html file.
7.	Upload all files on GitHub in a new repository.
8.	Visit https://www.netlify.com/.
9.	Make a fresh account or log in to your existing account.
10.	Authorize github from settings or Choose 'New Site from Git'.
11.	Choose Github.
12.	A new window will open follow the steps and authorize Netlify to your Github.
13.	Choose 'Configure Netlify on Github'.
14.	A new window will open.
15.	Scroll down and choose 'Only selected repositories'.
16.	Select the above created repository.
17.	Click 'Save' or 'install Netlify on the repository'.
18.	Click 'Deploy'.
19.	Wait for site to be hosted.
20.	Open the site link https://nifty-babbage-7652c7.netlify.app/.
21.	Copy the link till '.netlify.app'.
22.	Add this address to app_startup_code. 
23.	Commit the changes.
24.	Go to Netlify.
25.	Wait for latest commit to be published.
26.	Your website is ready. 
27.	Visit the website. Wait for the model to load.
28.	Click on ‘Skin Disease Detector’ and choose the image you want to test.
29.	Wait for the results to get displayed.
•	Note: 
	Size of the dataset is large in terms of disk space, making size of project large.
	It would be better to use Google Colab to run the model as it has stronger computational capacity.
